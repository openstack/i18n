Translations
------------

To help with translation,
:doc:`become an official translator <official_translator>` and join your
language team. Then go to
`translation website <https://translate.openstack.org/>`_ to start translation.
You can find prioritized translation jobs as I18n team at the top of the page.

:doc:`Your language team <lang_team>` may have useful information to help our
translation efforts including translation guidelines, priorities, communication
tools and so on. It is worth visited.
You can find your language team page at
https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/I18nTeam/team.
If you have questions, you can contact your coordinators.

To report translation errors, see :doc:`bug_report`.
