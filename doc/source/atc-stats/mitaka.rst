============
Mitaka cycle
============

* Period: 2015-08-01 to 2016-01-30
* Patch on governance repository: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/281145/
  (`diff <http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/governance/commit/?id=8b3c83f28102c7b47688fbaca970a52a76eb6de5>`__)
* This following statistics data is calculated using up-to-date
  `translation_team.yaml <http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/i18n/tree/tools/zanata/translation_team.yaml?id=a67e08d86cc78907da38d5f09b8be6f71d1979a0>`__
  (date: Jan 15, 2017).
* When proposing extra ATCs at that time, some translators were not included in
  `translation_team.yaml <http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/i18n/tree/tools/zanata/translation_team.yaml?id=73a36041dbdc45212051c60cbeef3f7783200fd2>`__
  file. It seems that 1) new translators were joined and the statistics was
  calculated but the file was already created, or 2) there might be some lack
  of communication with language coordinators, since I18n encouraged each
  language coordinator to update this file.
* [ianychoi] Although one year was already passed (as of now: Jan 15, 2017),
  I really would like to say those translators also contributed translations
  with I18n team members. For acknowledgement purpose, I write their Zanata ID,
  name, and language team in here :

  * Zbyněk Schwarz (id: tsbook) - Czech
  * Rob Cresswell (id: robcresswell) - English (United Kingdom)
  * Heleno Jimenez de la Cruz (id: heleno_jimenez) - Spanish (Mexico)
  * Jori Kuusinen (id: nuyori) - Finnish (Finland)
  * Masaki Matsushita (id: mmasaki) - Japanese
  * Amandeep Singh Saini (jimidar) - Punjabi (India)
  * Łukasz Jernas (id: deejay1) - Polish (Poland)
