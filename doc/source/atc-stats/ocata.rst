Ocata cycle
===========

* Period: 2016-08-01 to 2017-01-05
* Patch on governance repository: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/417569/
  (`diff <http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/governance/commit/?id=bd71cefff1302ed04fc21faac5cf967365a7d7c7>`__)
* Note: the period is relative short because of release cycle change

  * More information: https://releases.openstack.org/ocata/schedule.html &
    https://ttx.re/splitting-out-design-summit.html

* [ianychoi] Note: only "translated" metric was considered to follow the
  description in I18n contributor guide. After more detail investigation on
  previous ATC criteria, review metrics were also considered.
  Fortunately, the three translators (jftalta - 117 translated & 2897 reviews,
  myamamot - 725 reviews, mucahit - 1241 reviews) are also regarded ATCs from
  Newton cycle :) - I keep it as record for the next ATC list changes.
