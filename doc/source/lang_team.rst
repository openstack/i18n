=============
Language Team
=============

OpenStack I18n team is a team to coordinate all language translations
and cooperation with the I18n team and the development teams.
I18n team usually has a working plan.

Although each language team could follow the I18n team working plan,
your team may also decide your own work items and priorities as a
language team.

Each language team may have useful information to help our translation
efforts including translation guidelines, priorities, communication
tools and so on. It is worth visited.
You can find your language team page at
https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/I18nTeam/team.
If you have questions, you can contact your coordinators.

If you cannot find your local team, you can request to
:ref:`create a local translation team <creating-lang-team>`.

Roles in a Language Team
------------------------

There are three different roles in a translation team:

Member (translator)
  A person who can submit translations.

Reviewer
  A person who can proofread translations and
  mark them as reviewed (approved) or rejected.

Coordinator
  A privileged member in a translation team who can help
  in team management tasks, such as approving new members
  and reviewing contributions to that language.
  We also have task coordinators for specific tasks.

Managing a Language Team
------------------------

This section tries to share best practices on how team coordinators
manages their language team. Feel free to add useful information!

* When a new member request is received, a coordinator approves (or
  rarely rejects) the request. At the moment, Zanata provides no way
  to communicate with language team members, so it is better to
  inform the new member of ways usually used in the language team.
* When a translation period towards a new OpenStack release approaches,
  it is recommended to coordinate and prioritize translation efforts.
* Setting up a communication channel among team members is recommended.
  It encourage team communications to discuss various translation related
  topics.
* It is a good idea to organize glossaries and initiate related discussion.
* ...

Of course there is no need that team coordinators do all items.
You can collaborate your team members and share ideas.

Creating a Language Team
------------------------

If you want to create a language team and you want to be a coordinator,
please follow below steps:

1. Follow :doc:`the step <official_translator>` to register an ID in
   the translation website.

2. Write an email to "openstack-i18n@lists.openstack.org" to introduce
   yourself and the language team you want to create, together with
   your ID on Zanata.

3. When your request is approved, add an item in "Local Translation
   Teams" in the wiki page, create a wiki page under page
   `I18nTeam <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/I18nTeam/team>`_
   (for example, I18nTeam/team/zh_cn) to introduce your team, with
   the following information at least: the contact information,
   the web page, and the work items.

Then, your locale translation team is created successfully.
You can enroll more people to join and start your translation work.

Keep in mind to work with your `local user group
<https://groups.openstack.org/>`_ and the `OpenStack Ambassadors
<https://groups.openstack.org/ambassador-program>`_
to raise awareness and gather members :)
